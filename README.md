# Real-time-Face-Mask-Detector
Contribution to covid-19 crisis

Perhaps one of the most striking lifestyle changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is the mandatory use of face masks in grocery stores, restaurants and other public places.
Wearing a mask, especially when in close proximity to others, is imperative to slowing the spread of COVID-19. Scientists have proven that masking lowers COVID-19 cases.
But we are finding people in public who are not wearing their mask properly. This decreases the effectiveness of masking and increases the wearerâ€™s risk of catching and spreading 
the disease.

OBJECTIVE: Create a real-time face mask detector to check whether a person in wearing a mask properly or not.

IN THE PROJECT:
	Convolutional neural networks is used to train the model. For real-time detection, open-cv is used.
	The xml file contains the configs for the camera to detect the face. It is also inbuilt in the tensorflow module in python.

FUTURE SCOPE:
	This model can be implemented in cameras in public places. Similar models can be deployed like, helmet detection and seat belt detection. 

STEPS TO USE : 
    Just run the code and you are good to go.
    Also the file 'mymodel.h5' which is the format saved by keras, is the trained model ready to be deployed instantly to save time. 
    Just download and load the model to save computation and time! Cheers!
